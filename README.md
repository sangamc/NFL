R project for collecting NFL stats and making projections. Currently using FFA projections but will work to make all projections directly in program.

FootballOutsiders.R  Scrape football outsiders website for data tables.
Fantasy_Cruncher.R   Scrape weekly historical Fantasy production
DKSalaries.R         Prep player pool + projections for LPSolve or upload to web based solver
Rotoworld.inj.R      scrape NFL injury reports (part of DKSalaries.R)
stattleship_nfl.R    Use StattleShip API to get historical player stats (this is easily the best source of data for DFS playrs)
